# Task 2 - README

This folder contains the implementation of a simple TODO application. Below is a description of the files:

## Files

### `todo.ts`
- A TypeScript file that defines the structure and logic for managing a TODO list.
- Includes functionality to:
    - Add new tasks.
    - Mark tasks as completed.
    - Delete tasks.
    - List all tasks.

### `todo.js`
- A compiled JavaScript version of `todo.ts`.
- Provides the same functionality as `todo.ts` but is used for environments that run JavaScript directly.

## Usage
- Use `todo.ts` for TypeScript projects.
- Use `todo.js` for JavaScript-only environments.
- Both files provide the same core TODO management features.
